                                My name is Peter, and I'm a student currently studying computer science at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.
                                Aside from coding, my interests lie in weightlifting, playing the piano (15 years strong!), and cooking.

                                My current focus in my education is on web development. I've completed coursework in both basic web development and
                                advanced webdev, which focuses primarily on the use and learning of frameworks. I loved it so much I decided to TA
                                internet programming!
                            </span>
                            <span>
                                In addition to web development, I'd love to learn more about 
                                AI/ML, compilers, natural language processing, and systems programming.

                                This current semester, I don't have much time for personal projects (aside from my <a href='https://peterolsen1.github.io/gopher-transit/' style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}} target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">MetroTransit app</a>), however 
                                I'm currently working on a few large class projects, including:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A complex sheet muisc webapp üéπ</li>

                                </ol>
                                Which should be included on this site by the end of the semester.
